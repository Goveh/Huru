This text will be about float variables
Float is a shortened term for "floating point." By definition, it's a fundamental data type built into the compiler that's used to define numeric values with floating decimal points.
Float and double are similar types. Float is a single-precision, 32-bit floating point data type; double is a double-precision, 64-bit floating point data type. The biggest differences are in precision and range.
